# CI Demo: Simple Python App + GitHub Actions

This repository is a minimal CI demo that includes a sample Python function, automated tests using `pytest`, and a GitHub Actions workflow which runs the tests on push/PR.

## Project Contents ✅
- `app.py` — Minimal sample Python module exposing `add(a, b)` and a small CLI
- `test_app.py` — Pytest tests validating `add`
- `requirements.txt` — Dependencies (currently `pytest` for tests)
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — GitHub Actions workflow to run tests on push/PR to `main`

## Quickstart — Run tests locally (PowerShell)
1. Install dependencies:
```powershell
C:/Users/richa/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python313/python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run tests:
```powershell
C:/Users/richa/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python313/python.exe -m pytest -q
```

If you prefer to use an activated virtual environment:
```powershell
# create and activate a virtualenv (PowerShell)
python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest -q
```

## GitHub Actions CI
The workflow at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is a basic pipeline which:

1. Runs on `ubuntu-latest` for push and pull request events targeting `main`
2. Checks out the code using `actions/checkout`.
3. Sets up Python using `actions/setup-python`.
4. Installs dependencies and runs `pytest`.

This CI setup is intentionally minimal and designed to demonstrate the test-run workflow. You can extend it by:
- Adding lint and style checks (ruff, black, flake8)
- Adding test coverage reporting (`pytest-cov`)
- Running tests across multiple Python versions via a matrix build

## Notes & Next steps 💡
- If this project should be the Flask app (or other full application), we currently replaced `app.py` with a minimal `add` function to match the test file. If you want to restore the original Flask app, consider:
  1. Moving the Flask app into its own folder (e.g. `webapp/`) and adding dedicated tests for that app, or
  2. Writing tests for the existing Flask app (using TestClient/httpx) and restoring the original code.
- If you’d like, I can rework the repository structure to keep the demo separate from the project or add additional CI job steps (lint, static typing, coverage, or multiple Python matrices).
